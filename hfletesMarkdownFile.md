**My Experience** 
During the past month I was in a coding passantia, were I tryed to explain to myself the bascis of programing and how the structure is used in daily life.
*What I can learn*
There is a lot of things I still nead to learn, and also reinforce what I already learn because it is important 
***Things I dont understand***
I really have to leanr how to navigate on my Github portal, because today I was very lost and had to ask for help.
